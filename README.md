## Installing LinkKit

LinkKit supports [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

### Swift Package Manager

To install Plaid Link using [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) you can follow the [tutorial published by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) using the URL for this repository with the current version:

1. In Xcode, select ‚ÄúFile‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdd Packages...‚Äù
2. Enter `https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm.git`

Alternatively, you can add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm.git", from: "6.0.0")
```

**Recommendation**: Use the [plaid-link-spm](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm) repo instead of the main [plaid-link-ios](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios) repository. The main repository with full git history is very large (~1 GB), and Swift Package Manager always downloads the full repository with all git history. This [plaid-link-ios-spm](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm) repository is much smaller (less than 500kb), making the download faster.

This [plaid-link-spm](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm) repository just contains a pointer to the precompiled XCFramework included in the [latest plaid-link-ios release](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios/releases/latest) (typically ~20MB). Since [plaid-link-ios](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios) doesn't provide source code it's strongly recommended that users depend on [plaid-link-ios-spm](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm) instead.

**Validation**: When using plaid-link-ios-spm, the downloaded `LinkKit.xframework` isn't visible in the project navigator. To validate the authenticity of a plaid-link-ios-spm package, you can confirm that the `Package.swift` file references a binary XCFramework from https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios/releases.

### CocoaPods

1. If you haven‚Äôt already, install the latest version of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
2. If you don‚Äôt have an existing Podfile, create one by running: `pod init`
3. Add this line to your Podfile: `pod 'Plaid'`
4. Install the pods by running: `pod install`
5. To update to newer releases in the future, run: `pod install`

## Contents

üì± This repository contains multiple sample applications (requiring Xcode 14) that demonstrate integration and use of Plaid Link for iOS.
* [Swift+UIKit](LinkDemo-Swift)
* [Swift+SwiftUI](LinkDemo-SwiftUI)
* [Objective-C](LinkDemo-ObjC)

üìö Detailed instructions on how to integrate with Plaid Link for iOS can be found in our main documentation at [plaid.com/docs/link/ios][link-ios-docs]. 

5Ô∏è‚É£ If you're updating from version 4.x to 5.x please read our [migration guide](v5-migration-guide.md).

:warning: All integrations must use version 4.1.0 (released January 2023) or higher to maintain support for Chase OAuth connections.

### About the LinkDemo Xcode projects

Before building and running the sample application replace any Xcode placeholder strings (like `<#GENERATED_LINK_TOKEN#>`) in the code with the appropriate value so that Plaid Link is configured properly. For convenience the Xcode placeholder strings are also marked as compile-time warnings.

## Plaid Link Integration Instructions

### Steps to acquire a Link token

- [Sign up for a Plaid account](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup) to get an API key.
- Make a request to [our API](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart/#introduction) using your API key.

Build and run the demo application to experience the Link flow for yourself.
